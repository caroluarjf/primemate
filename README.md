# PrimeMate

PrimeMate is a Python program designed to customize and schedule alerts for reminders, appointments, or system events on Windows. It features a simple interface where users can add timed events and receive alerts when these events occur.

## Features

- **Schedule Events**: Add events with specific times and get notified when they occur.
- **Custom Alerts**: Receive alerts with a message and an audible beep.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: PrimeMate runs in the background, continuously checking for upcoming events.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Windows operating system (due to the use of `winsound` for alerts)

## Installation

To use PrimeMate, clone this repository and ensure you have Python installed on your Windows machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PrimeMate.git
cd PrimeMate
```

## Usage

1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python PrimeMate.py
   ```
2. Add events within the code or modify it to accept user input for scheduling.
3. PrimeMate will alert you with a beep sound and message when the scheduled time is reached.

## Example

```python
# Schedule a reminder 1 minute from now
one_minute_later = datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=1)
prime_mate.add_event(one_minute_later, "Time for your meeting!")
```
